    "contents": "\r\nBackground\r\nA research team has conducted a study to understand the receptivity of the public towards COVID-19 vaccination. As part of their study, data from the Imperial College London YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub was utilised. From the data obtained, some visualizations were created. The aim of this post is to provide suggestions for improvement of the visualizations as well as to propose other visualizations for further analysis of the data to allow deeper insights to be gleaned.\r\nA. Critique of Data Visualization Provided\r\nThe original visualizations created by the team is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Provided Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the original data visualization provided, the following are some comments on the clarity and aesthetics aspects of the visualization.\r\nClarity\r\n1. Titles of the charts and legends are not well worded The title of the chart on the left could have been better phrased to reflect the content and key message of the chart.  The horizontal axes could have been better labelled to “Proportion of respondents”.  For the vertical axes, it is unnecessary to have the “Country” axis label as the country labels are self-explanatory.  For the legend, there is no need to label “Vac1” as it is not meaningful to the reader. 2. Colour chosen for categories not intuitive Colours selected to represent the categorical responses should reflect the nature of the responses.  For example, Strongly agree (1) and Agree (2) should be of the same colour hue but different in tones/shades to reflect intensity (i.e. (1) should be darker/more intense than (2)). Similarly, Strongly Disagree (5) and Disagree (4) should be of the same colour hue but of different tones/shades to reflect intensity (i.e. (5) should be more intense then (4)).3. Uncertainty in the data was not represented For the chart on the right, since sample proportion was used, confidence intervals of the sample proportion should be included to allow readers to understand the margin of error in the sample estimates and to interpret if the proportions reflected are statistically different. \r\n4. Inclination and skew of responses not easily observed with 100% stacked bar chart While the 100% stacked bar chart demonstrates the proportions of the responses for each country, it does not intuitively show the skew and inclination of the responses for each country at a glance. With a diverging stacked bar chart, the inclinations of the responses is more evident. 5. Insufficient data to draw meaningful observations Both charts essentially reflect countries’ receptivity towards the COVID-19 vaccine. However, no further observations and analysis are available from the charts. In order to glean deeper insights, the data from the variable used (var_1) should be compared with data from other variables for analysis. \r\n6. Bar chart on the right sorted in descending order For the chart on the right, countries are sorted in descending order of the proportion of the public which had strongly agreed to the statement that they were willing to take the vaccine. By arranging in this manner,it allows easier identification of countries which had a higher receptivity towards the vaccine.\r\nAesthetics\r\n1. Horizontal arrangement of the bar chart As the bar charts are labelled according to country names, a horizontal mapping of the bar chart allows the countries’ names to be seem in full and in a less cluttered manner than if arranged in a vertical layout. 2. Country names should be in Title Case instead of lowercase Country names are proper nouns and should be in Title Case instead of the current lowercase used. 3. Consistent use of colours There was consistent use of colours in both graphs, where dark blue was used to represent the proportion of respondents who had strongly agreed.4. Consistency in number of decimals on horizontal axes The chart on the left used whole number labels while the one on the right had labels with 1 decimal place. For consistency and for the charts to look less cluttered, whole number labels could be used.5. Good choice of font type, size and colour Font type, size and colour selected in the chart is an appropriate choice as it is easily read by the reader. However, to emphasize key messages of the chart, annotations of different size and colour could be used.\r\nB. Proposed Alternative Data Visualization\r\nSketch of Proposed Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of and Rationale for Proposed Visualization\r\n1. Side by side comparison of responses to different questions The proposed visualization would include 2 graphs placed side by side with readers having an option to select the questions (variables) for which the charts are representing. This will allow users to compare responses to the different questions and derive deeper insights into the responses.\r\nFor example, for a country with high proportion of public willing to take the vaccine, a comparison with their responses to other questions such as “I am worried about getting COVID19” or “I believe government authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine” could provide deeper understanding on the motivation of respondents’ receptivity towards vaccination. Application wise, public health authorities would be able to determine if there were any public health messaging that would drive vaccination uptake more than others.\r\n2. Filters by demographical factors to allow deeper analysis There are also filters for the chart on the left, to allow users to refine the charts displayed by gender, age range, household size and number of children in households, which may provide interesting insights into possible factors linked to vaccination receptivity and perceptions.\r\n3. Option to select Confidence Intervals for error bars For the chart on the right, users have the option of selecting 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels to view the estimated proportions (and their confidence intervals) of respondents strongly agreeing with the respective statements.\r\n4. Use of suitable Title and Write-up  The title and write-up provides context to the visualization and helps the reader understand the utility of the charts.\r\n5. Inttuitive use of colours For the diverging stacked bar chart on the left, colours with same hues but differing tones are used to represent similar responses (i.e., Dark green for Strongly Agree, Green for Agree, Grey for Neutral, and Red and Dark Red for Disagree and Strongly Disagree). This allows for the reader to interpret the charts more easily and intuitively.\r\n6. Use of error bars to represent uncertainty To provide an indication of uncertainty of the sample proportion, error bars are used on the right, with varying levels of confidence. This allows the user to have a better understanding of the uncertainty in data shown as well as whether there were statistical diferences in the estimates for the various countries.\r\n7. Diverging stacked bar charts show skew and inclination intuitively Compared to the 100% stacked bar chart, the diverging bar chart shows skewness and inclination of the proportions more effectively and intuitively. At a glance, the user is able to tell which countries are more or less inclined towards COVID19 vaccination.\r\n8. Both charts sorted by countries’ names in alphabetical order  As the diverging stacked bar chart clearly displays the inclination of the countries, there is no need to sort the error bar chart on the right by decreasing level of willingness. Instead, both were sorted similarly to allow for easy comparison of country data between the 2 charts.\r\nC. Proposed Data Visualization\r\nThe proposed data visualization is found at the following URL:https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel.lin.yongyan#!/vizhome/DatavizMakeover2_1316h/Dashboard1?publish=yes  A screenshot of the visualization is as follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Critique of Data Visualization Provided\r\nBased on the original data visualization provided, the following are some comments on the clarity and aesthetics aspects of the visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Provided Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nTitle is not well wordedThe title of the chart should provide the reader with an overview of the key message of the chart and not merely mention the data and axes plotted (E.g. Resident labour force by age).\r\n2\r\nNo vertical axis and labels for both axesWhile the title mentioned that the chart reflected Resident Labour Force by Age, it did not specify what the vertical axis represented or how it was computed. Even though there were values provided in the table below the graph, it was not clear if the line graphs were plotted based on those values. There was also no mention on what the values in the table were or how they were computed. The reader is left guessing what the values meant.\r\n3\r\nImproper use of line graphsLine graphs are usually used to display trends in data over time, presenting several data points as one continuous evolution. In this case, bar graphs would be more appropriate for comparing the data across various age-bands which are categorical.\r\n4\r\nLack of annotations and use of data-ink to tell data story and emphasize key messagesThe writeup provided mentioned that the share of resident labour force within 2 age bands, 25-54 and 55 & over, had fallen and risen, respectively. However, this is not immediately evident from the chart since there are no annotations or use of data-ink to guide the reader to the main message.\r\n5\r\nOnly 2 time points provided for comparisonThe chart only provides data at 2 time points, 2009 and 2019. Without the data points in between 2009 and 2019, the reader is not able to tell if there are any particular trends in the data or if the increase or decrease mentioned is a once off comparison.\r\n6\r\nInclusion of data table adds to chart clutterBy including the data table in the chart, the chart appears more cluttered and the reader will find himself distracted, having to cross reference between the points on the line graph and the corresponding values in the table.\r\nAesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nColour chosen does not contrast sufficiently with the backgroundThe colour chosen for the 2009 line does not contrast sufficiently with the background and does not stand out easily. A more contrasting colour should be chosen to make the line more easily seen. Alternatively, a white background would have allowed the lines graphs to stand out more prominently.\r\n2\r\nConsistent use of coloursColours used to denote and label the line and data for 2009 (in grey) and 2019 (in blue) have been consistently applied. This allows for easier reference between the set of data in the table and the line graph, though not ideal as mentioned in point 1.\r\n3\r\nElimination of legendTo reduce chart clutter, a legend for the chart was not used. Instead, the line graphs were labelled directly.\r\n4\r\nUse of tick marks to demarcate age-bands on the horizontal axis.Tick marks are usually not used on a categorical scale but more for continuous scales. However in this chart, since a line graph was used for a categorical scale, tick marks were appropriately used to demarcate the age bands on the horizontal axis.\r\n5\r\nGood choice of font type, size and colourFont type, size and colour selected in the chart is an appropriate choice as it is easily read by the reader. However, to emphasize key messages of the chart, annotations of different size and colour could be used.\r\nB. Proposed Alternative Data Visualization\r\nSketch of Proposed Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Data Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages and Reasons for Proposed Design\r\n1. Use of suitable Title and Write-up  The title and write-up provides context to the visualization and helps the reader zoom in and focus on the key messages and relevant portions of the chart\r\n2. Use of vertical axis and appropriate axes labels  The inclusion of both axes and axes labels allows the reader to have clarity and understand what is depicted in the chart.\r\n3. Data points between 2009 to 2019 provided  The initial provided graph only provided a comparison between 2 years, 2009 and 2019. The increase observed between the 2 years could be a once off and it would not be possible to observe it there was a trend in the data. However, by including the years in between 2009 and 2019, trends in the data can be observed.\r\n4. Appropriate use of Line Graphs  The line graphs used in the top chart allows the reader to visualize trends more easily, since the lines present several data points as one continuous evolution over time. Bar charts were selected for the bottom chart to provide a more visual impact of the absolute numbers of residents in the workforce,for each of the age groups.\r\n5. Use of annotations to highlight key points  Annotations in the chart were used to draw readers’ attention to the key points mentioned in the write-up. This is to allow readers to quickly understand the focus of the charts.\r\n6. Exclusion of Data Table  In the original visualization, a data table was included. This contributed to chart clutter and reduced the clarity of the chart. In the proposed design, data tables were not included but important values were highlighted using annotations where necessary.\r\n7. Selection of colours and fonts to facilitate the reading of charts  The background was kept a consistent white colour, while the colours of text and chart elements were selected to be of a striking colour. This is to allow the reader to more easily read and view the chart elements. Elements which are not key are kept to a lighter shade to reduce distraction from the main elements.\r\n8. Elimination of legends  The use of appropriate labels for the charts meant that there was no need for chart legends as readers can easily identify which age bands the chart elements belonged to. This helped to reduce chart clutter.\r\n9. Consistent use of colours  Colours chosen were consistently applied to elements relating to the same age groups to allow easy referencing by readers and to avoid confusion.\r\nC. Proposed Data Visualization\r\nThe proposed data visualization is found at the following URL:https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel.lin.yongyan#!/vizhome/DataVizMakeover1_16118057789510/Dashboard?publish=yes  A screenshot of the visualization is as follow.\r\nD. Preparation of Data Visualization\r\n(1) Derivation of Data from MOM’s website\r\nThe data used for the visualization was obtained from the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) website (https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx). Of the tables provided, Table 7 (Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (June)) was used for the data visualisation. \r\n(2) Data cleaning and preparation\r\nTable 7’s data provided the number of residents who were in the resident labour force by 5 year age bands. To prepare the data for analysis, empty columns in the table were removed, and data for the desired age bands (i.e. 15-24yrs, 25-54yrs, 55yrs and above) were derived. A screenshot of the derived table and relevant formulae are as shown below. The formula used are  P2 = =SUM(B2:C2)  Q2 = =SUM(D2:I2)  R2 = =SUM(J2:M2) \r\nTo derive the data for the second chart where Proportion of residents in the workforce for the respective age bands, the following is a screenshot of the derivation carried out.\r\n(3) Import Data to Tableau\r\nThe Excel spreadsheet with the created tables were imported in to Tableau as shown below.\r\n(4) Creation of Visualization - Line Graph\r\nAfter importing the data to Tableau, I started with the creation of the visualization for Proportion of Workforce. * Years (named F1 here) was dragged to the Columns field  * (15-24), (25-54), and (55&Above), which contained the proportion data, were dragged to the Rows field.  * Measure Names was also placed in the Filters field and Colour panel.  The resulting chart is shown as follow.  To remove the legend, the line graphs needed to be labelled. This is done by  * Bringing Measure Names onto the Label panel, and clicking on the Label panel  * Indicating  in the Text field  * Selecting Line Ends and checking Label End of Lines  The following is a screenshot of the step.  The 2 end points of the line graphs were also annotated to allow the reader to easily view and to reinforce the points mentioned in the write-up. This is done by  * Right-clicking on the point  * Select Annotate Mark  * Input as shown below.  The title is also updated as follows.  Next was to fix the Proportion (vertical) axis to 100 to provide an indication of the proportion out of 100%. This is done by right clicking on the vertical axis and selecting Fixed in the dialog box as shown.  The following is the final Line Graph prepared. \r\n(5) Creation of Visualization - Bar Graphs\r\nOn a separate sheet, Year was placed in the Columns field and (15-24),(25-54),(55 & above) were placed in the row field. However, to combine the 3 groups onto the same graph, (25-54) and (55 & above) were dragged to the vertical axis of (15-24) as shown.  The result is as shown.  Then Measure Names was placed in the Colour panel to provide a distinction between the various age bands. The result is as shown.  Following that, similar editing was done (as Line Graphs) to edit the title. The final Bar Chart is as follows. \r\n(6) Creation of Dashboard - Final Visualization\r\nFinally to create the eventual visual, the line graph (Proportion) and bar charts (Absolute) were placed onto the dashboard. One Text field was placed at the top for the Title and Write-Up for the visual and another Text field was placed at the bottom for the Source of the data. The final visual completed is as shown. \r\n\r\nE. Major Observations from the Visualizations\r\n(1) There was a trend in the data of Proportion of Resident Workforce among the age groups.  Proportion of Resident Workforce among 25-54 year olds and those 55 years and above were observed to have a decreasing trend and increasing trend respectively from 2009 to 2019.  With data from 2 years (2009 and 2019), the reader was only able to ascertain whether there was an increase or decrease in the proportion. With the data from every year between 2009 to 2019, trend data is now observed. (2) Actual numbers of 25-54 year olds were increasing while proportion was decreasing.  While the proportion of resident workforce among the 25-54 year olds were decreasing, the actual numbers of the same were actually increasing (as observed in the bar charts).  This would not have been evident if actual figures of the resident workforce among this age group had not been charted and examined. (3) Increase in numbers of resident workforce among older age group is faster than that in the younger age groups.  The bar chart also reveals that number of resident workforce among 55 years and above increased at a faster rate than the increase among the 25-54 years age group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
