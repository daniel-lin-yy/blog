# Background

A data visualization was created to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of armed conflict in selected South-east Asia countries between 2015-2020. The visualization is based on data provided at The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED).

The purpose of this post is to critique the visualization and to propose an alternative visualization and interactive techniques to improve the current design.
